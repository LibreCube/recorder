SauerEnchanced

v14.3 BETA

Thanks to K1P57A for flag and blip textures.

Thanks to Quaker66 for helping me with development on this mod.

If sometimes sound will not be played that probably means game is trying to play too much sounds at once. Try "/maxsoundsatonce 10" or higher value.
NOTE: 3D menus don't work anymore. Please be patient before i fix it...

--EXTRA MAP EFFECTS--
How to use additional map effects and .se ent storage files.

RAIN AND SNOW:
Snow: /newent particles 77 <radius> <wind strenght>
Rain: /newent particles 78 <radius> <wind strenght>
Glow: /newent particles 79 <color 0xRGB> <size> <flicker 0/1>

If there's default flare-rain on a map, SauerEnhanced automaticly replaces it with enhanced one.

ADDING SOUDNS:

Just do /newent sound <SoundNum> <Radius1> <Radius2> <none> 1

5th attribute MUST be 1 !!!

To save extra map fx (sounds and particles): /writesefile

For debugging SE file saving/reading use the /sefiledbg var
You can save particles to SE file only if attr1 is higher than 76

You can edit SE files manually:
Just go to SauerEnhanced/ents/ and open .se file with Notepad or WordPad

END...
